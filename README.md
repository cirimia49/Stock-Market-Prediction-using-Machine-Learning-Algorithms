# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the stock market trend and price. 

I have used the apple stock - AAPL - for a period of a year and predicted the direction of the trend in the 13th month.

The algorithms used were: 
- Support vector machine(with three different kernels: rbf, linear and polynomial)
- KNN (K-nearest neighbour)
- Quadratic regression
- ANN (Artificial neural network)

The accuracies were compared in the last part and the trend was predicted to the user.
